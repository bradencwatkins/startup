#Notes
here are all of the notes I will leave for my project >:)

##conflictTest and Intro
I learned quite a few things from this first assignment (much more that 5 points worth).
First is how to navigate around Git in general. It is quite confusing at first, but it has become more managable.
I also learned how to commit, push, and pull changes of code to and from GitHub. Its pretty cool.
I also learned how to manage conflicts, and how to format GitHub.
