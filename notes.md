# Notes
here are all of the notes I will leave for my project >:)

## conflictTest and Intro
I learned quite a few things from this first assignment (much more that 5 points worth).
First is how to navigate around Git in general. It is quite confusing at first, but it has become more managable.
I also learned how to commit, push, and pull changes of code to and from GitHub. Its pretty cool.
I also learned how to manage conflicts, and how to format GitHub.

## Creating The Website!!!
I learned how to launch my first website using AWS. I got it done successfully, but pretty much all of it went over my head lol. I know how to follow a tutorial though!!
[here is the link to the website.](https://35.172.60.97) It is going to become something epic >:)
to get in from the console I gotta do ssh [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]

## Domain name shenanigans  
I learned how to connect a domain name to my server, and also how to make a web server secure.  
It wasn't a very fun process, because I must've missed some key instruction somewhere.
Nevertheless, say hello to [marryabook.com](https://marryabook.com)  

## HTML fun  
I was introduced to the main concepts and general flow of HTML, but I am not super comfortable writing my own HTML page.  
Luckily there is always the future! HTML seems pretty easy though, and seems to allow a margin of error, which is more than most coding can say.
