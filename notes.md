# Notes
here are all of the notes I will leave for my project >:)

## conflictTest and Intro
I learned quite a few things from this first assignment (much more that 5 points worth).
First is how to navigate around Git in general. It is quite confusing at first, but it has become more managable.
I also learned how to commit, push, and pull changes of code to and from GitHub. Its pretty cool.
I also learned how to manage conflicts, and how to format GitHub.

## Creating The Website!!!
I learned how to launch my first website using AWS. I got it done successfully, but pretty much all of it went over my head lol. I know how to follow a tutorial though!!
[here is the link to the website.](http://35.172.60.97) It is going to become something epic >:)
to get in from the console I gotta do ssh [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
